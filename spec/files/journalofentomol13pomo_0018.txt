A List of California Arachnida 

This list is compiled from already published but scattered papers. Many of these 
 are local records of specimens and new species collected by many students through a 
 number of years and determined for us for the most part by Banks and Chamberlin. 
 As numerous earlier papers in this Journal have taken up the distribution of local 
 forms only a hint of this will be given. There are included in this list records other 
 than local. If the distribution is general some indication is given. A few hints as to 
 characteristic features are given when possible. The family characteristics are com- 
 piled by the aid of the works of Banks, Ewing, Comstock and several others. In 
 order to save space the literature references are given in abbreviated form at the end 
 of each section, especially as there are a number of papers and lists already published 
 which give this material in great detail.
