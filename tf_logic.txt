if no 5 items input:

  return ||0||-1||
  word list match - 0
  score -1

if word is empty:

  return ||0|$currentString|$wordListMatches||

  where currentString is from input stripped
  and worldListMatches is from input stripped
  wordlist match 0
  score - wordListMatch??

**********GENUS**********************
for Genus + species
  if genus found and species has punctuation at the end (end of the name because of comma, end of the sentence etc.)

    return ||0|$currentString|$wordListMatches||
    where $wordListMatches is contactenation of strings, like 0S

  if genus found and species, but not end of the sentence
    $currentString $cleanCandidateWord|species|$wordListMatches"."$score||-1||
    search continues... found species, can be subspecies
  
  for abbreviated Genera (1-2 letters (where '-' can also be the first letter ???):
    expand Genus if last used genus is known with this letters
    if abbrev did not make sense (genus is not found):
      ||0||-1|| 
      - result is nothing
      Also means 2 letter genera are not found by NameFinder

  if next word starts right after genus
    if next word is potential abbr genus
      ****$cleanCandidateWord|genus|0|$currentString|$wordListMatches||\n"
    if next word is subgenus
      if genus is abbreviated find it and extend
        "$currentString ($cleanCandidateWord)|genus|$wordListMatches"."$scoreG||-1||\n"
      if abbr not found start new name from 'subgenus' as genus this time
        "$cleanCandidateWord|genus|$scoreG||-1||\n"
      else return genus (subgenus)
        "$currentString ($cleanCandidateWord)|genus|$wordListMatches"."$scoreG||-1||\n"
    if next word is genus
      ****"$cleanCandidateWord|genus|$scoreG|$currentString|$wordListMatches||\n"
  
  if next word is family
    if genus was abbreviated make it ""
      ****"||0|$currentString|$wordListMatches"; empty string genus -- should be ignored
    if genus and family -- return both as return_string1 and return_string2 correspondently
      ****||0|genus|genus_score|family|family_score

***********SPECIES**********
if subspecies:
  "$currentString $cleanCandidateWord|species|$wordListMatches"."$score||-1||\n"
  currently number of infrapsecies is unlimited
if rank
  "$currentString $candidateWord|rank|$wordListMatches"."$score||-1||\n";
  potentially also unlimited
